Apps like Birdfeed and books like programming the iPhone User Experience
are good examples of the kind of care and thoughtfulness that go into writing
great iPhone applications.  Something you don't see a lot of outside of the Mac and
iPhone realm.  Using the iPhone SDK is a lot like using a great Mac or iPhone app, there
are all sorts of fantastic features revealed as you pull back the layers.  Everyone is not going to appreciate this but that adds to the whole experience.  I say all this even after being rejected for my first app submission.  The rejection information was curt but also appropriate and useful.  I've since made some changes and re-submitted the application.  Hopefully the turn around will be a little quicker and I'll have my first app in the App Store: Rails Rankr.
